The solution is to check if the component is still mounted before performing any operations within the asynchronous callback.  We can use a `mounted` ref to track the component's lifecycle.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const intervalRef = useRef(null);
  const mounted = useRef(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    intervalRef.current = setInterval(() => {
      if (mounted.current) {
        console.log('Interval running');
      }
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
      mounted.current = false; // Update mounted ref on unmount
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This component is now safe from crashes during unmount</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
This corrected code ensures that the `setInterval` callback only attempts to update the console if the component is still mounted.  The `mounted.current = false` line is crucial for preventing the callback from running after the component is unmounted.
